# ics-generator

Personal converter to produce an ics file which is formatted the way I like it.

The yearly game plan of German ice hockey team Adler Mannheim is always provided without locations and with "vs." in the description, which I don't like.
Therefore I have this project, which takes the provided ics file and changes the location and description of the games.
Furthermore the Outlook status is set according to home game or games away. For international games and test games the description is added.
