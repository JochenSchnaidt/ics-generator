# ics-generator

Personal converter to produce an ics file which is formatted the way I like it.

The yearly game plan of German ice hockey Team Adler Mannheim is always provided without loacations and with "vs." in the description, which I don't like. Therefore I have a this project, which takes the provided ics file and changes the location and description of the games. Furthermore the Outlook status is set according to home game or games away.
